CSCI 101 Fall 2019
By Harry Pinkerton
Required to run: python 3.7

Run each file and follow the respecive prompts

=======================
randomintegers.py
=======================
This program randomly generates integers to a specified text file. numbers.txt is given as an example file


=======================
analyzeintegers.py
=======================
This program reads a file of integers and displays the number of integers,
their average,their maximum value, and their minimum value. Use numbers.txt generated from randomintegers.py to
recieve the stats of the randomly generated numbers.


=======================
filestats.py
=======================
This program asks the user for a file name and states the number of characters,
number of words, and number of lines in the file. Use this in conjunction with the sample piece of literature in command.txt to get
its file stats. 


=======================
numberlines.py
=======================
This program takes a pre-existing file and numbers each line of text. After
numbering each line of text, the program creates a new file. command.txt is given in this repository as 
a sample piece of text to number and numberedtestfile.txt is the default location that the numbered text file prints to.
